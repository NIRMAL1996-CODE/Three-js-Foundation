1. Parallax means -
In the real world, parallax is when things closer to you move faster than things far away as you move your head or walk.In Three.js, you can show parallax using camera movement based on mouse or scroll to shift objects at different speeds.

Example: looking out of a car window—nearby trees zoom past, distant mountains barely move.
